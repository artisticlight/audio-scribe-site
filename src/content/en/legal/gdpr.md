# GDPR Compliance

Audio Scribe is designed with privacy at its core and is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Data Minimization

We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide our service. On-device transcription collects no data at all.

## Your Rights

Under the GDPR, you have the right to:

- **Access** your personal data
- **Rectification** of inaccurate data
- **Erasure** ("right to be forgotten")
- **Data portability**
- **Object** to processing

## Data Processing

When using cloud transcription, audio is processed in the EU and is not retained after transcription is complete.

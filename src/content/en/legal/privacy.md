# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 17, 2026*

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Audio Scribe collects, how it's used, and your rights.

## Data We Collect

When using the **on-device model**, no audio or transcription data is collected or transmitted. Everything stays on your device.

When using **cloud models**, audio is transmitted via end-to-end encryption to our transcription service. Audio is processed in real-time and is not stored after transcription is complete.

## iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud sync, your transcriptions are stored in your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## Analytics

We collect anonymous, aggregated usage statistics (e.g., app launches, feature usage) to improve Audio Scribe. No personal data or transcription content is included.

## Contact

For privacy questions, contact us at privacy@audioscribe.app.

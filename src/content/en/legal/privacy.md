# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 22, 2026_

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Audio Scribe collects, how it's used, and your rights using the Audio Scribe application by **Artistic Forge Studio**.

## Data We Collect

When using the **on-device model**, no audio or transcription data is collected or transmitted. Everything stays on your device.

When using **cloud models**, audio is transmitted securely via end-to-end encryption to the **OpenAI Whisper REST API** for transcription processing. The audio is processed by OpenAI and is **not retained** by us or OpenAI after the transcription is complete. We do not use your audio data to train any AI models.

## iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud sync, your transcriptions are stored securely in your personal Apple iCloud account. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## Analytics

We collect anonymous, aggregated usage statistics (e.g., app launches, feature usage) to improve Audio Scribe. No personal data, audio, or transcription content is ever included in these metrics.

## Contact
